in ihubs site. community leads to its own site which is essentially one that says what ihub does, memberships, featured events, feutured blogs etc. essentially. its the home page all over again. lets change that to our own. one that says what we do as a community, our member ships, a select of random community members the jobs board twitter and our partners hapo chini.

note that the current community leads to members page which we shall find a home for shortly

add a claendar to the events page. you know how the events calendar looks like

membership leads to a membership about page which has a kitabbed table that also lists the members and has a writeboard which is kinda a forum. so i gues yeah, we shall create the forum later on.

make the member registration go to sign up page which then redirects you to fill the sign in page
since my images are bigger than ihubs, we shall have to change the format a little bit. so that we can retain  the medium size
